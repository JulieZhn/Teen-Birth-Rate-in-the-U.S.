            <p>By <a href="https://juliezhn.github.io/">Julie Zhu</a></p>
        </div>
        <p>Forty years ago, more than 50 out of every 1,000 teenagers aged 15 to 19 in the United States. gave birth.
            This was also when Sabrina Cabello, then a 16-year-old high school student from the Bronx, had her son. She
            had never received sex education, and she and her boyfriend at the time believed they were being careful by
            using the pull-out method.</p>
        <p>At that time, students usually didn’t take the health class until the last semester before
            graduation, by which time many were already sexually active. In Sabrina’s eyes, the class wasn’t effective
            in helping students prevent pregnancy, particularly with projects like the egg assignment.</p>
        <p>To pass class, Sabrina carried a boiled egg around for a week, pretending it was her baby. She needed to
            ensure her egg wasn’t cold or broken, so she put it in the refrigerator to keep it safe. Otherwise, her real
            baby might squeeze and break the egg, causing Sabrina to risk failing the class.
        </p>
        <p>“This is not a simulation of what parenting is like. An egg doesn’t cry, doesn’t need diaper changes, and
            there are no daycare costs,” said Sabrina in a recent interview. “This is not realistically helping anybody
            avoid pregnancy.”
        </p>
        <p>Since the 1980s, teen births increased until peaking in 1991, when more than 60 out of every 1,000 teenagers
            had babies. Since then, the number has steadily declined, and now there are only 13.2 births per 1,000
            female teenagers, marking a decrease of 78 percent.
        </p>
        <p>The significant improvement in reducing teen births is closely linked to the rise in education levels and
            increased access to resources and opportunities for females. In the 1980s, only about two-thirds of teenage
            girls graduated from high school. By 2022, this figure had risen to around 92 percent.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Since more teens' parents have graduated from high school in the past decades, teens are likely to follow
            suit and pursue higher education, said Dr. Claire Brindis, a Distinguished Emerita Professor of Pediatrics
            and Health Policy at the University of California, San Francisco. This trend provides them with more options
            and opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>Dr. Brindis noted that for today's female teens, having a baby is no longer the only way to feel positive
            about their identities, and teenagers realize that having a baby will hinder their promising future when
            they see more career opportunities are available.
        </p>
        <p>Although the country has generally experienced a great decline in teen births, there are still some states
            with high rates of teenage births. According to <a
                href='https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr73/nvsr73-02.pdf'>CDC’s 2022 birth data report</a>,
            Mississippi topped the list, with over 26 out of every 1,000 teenagers being teen moms. The state was
            followed by Arkansas (25), Louisiana (24), Kentucky (22), and Oklahoma (21).
        </p>
        <p>“These states are more conservative,” said Estelle Raboni, the director of Sexual and Reproductive Health at
            the Department of Health & Mental Hygiene in New York City. “Local cultural and religious beliefs about
            premarital sexual activity shape their public health policies.”
        </p>
        <p>According to an analysis of 2022 teen birth rate data from CDC and 2020 presidential election results from <a
                href='https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/results/president'>CNN</a>, nine of the top ten states with the
            highest teen birth rates had more Republican voters in the 2020
            presidential election. John S. Santelli, a Professor of Population and Family Health and Pediatrics at
            Columbia University, pointed out the association between political affiliations and teen birth rates.
        </p>
        <p>“Southern states and red states (states with more Republican voters) are generally more conservative toward
            sex and sex education, also more religiously conservative and less likely to get contraceptives, so teen
            pregnancy rates tend to be higher,” said Professor Santelli.
        </p>
        <p>A data regression model using CDC teen birth rates data at the U.S. county level and the 2022 American Census
            Survey shows the availability of sex education really mattered to birth rates among teenagers. Counties that
            emphasize abstinence in sex education tend to have higher teen birth rates, meaning teenagers there are
            still having sex, and are more likely to give birth compared to teenagers in counties that have no
            requirement for abstinence education.
        </p>
        <p>Among the <a
                href='https://siecus.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Sex-Ed-State-Law-and-Policy-Chart.pdf'>26
                states with emphasis on abstinence</a>, 18 were “red states” in the 2020 presidential election,
            according to an analysis of the data.</p>
        <p>
            Dr. Keri Weed, a psychology professor from the University of South Carolina Aiken, noted that health care
            officials in these states are aware of the situation, but funding for sex education traditionally comes from
            national programs that must follow abstinence-only guidelines. These guidelines are often shaped more by the
            political authorities in power and their religious beliefs than by what is proven to work, though this may
            change with shifts in political leadership.</p>
        <p>Beyond education and political factors, the data analysis shows that the poverty rate and related factors,
            such as health insurance coverage and median household income, significantly contribute to teen birth rates.
            Counties with higher teen poverty rates, lower insurance coverage, and lower median household incomes tend
            to have higher percentages of teen moms.</p>
        <p>“In a county with a much lower poverty rate, pregnant teens have more available options, such as continuing
            their education, finding jobs, and making informed decisions about marriage and parenthood, which might lead
            them to consider abortion,” said Dr. Weed.</p>
        <p>Dr. Weed also pointed out that these counties usually have higher median household incomes and insurance
            coverage rates, meaning more healthcare providers would be available there to offer more options for
            pregnant teenagers, including abortion and adoption services, as well as support for those who choose to
            keep their babies, and point them in the right direction.</p>

        <h3>The Big Picture: Decline in Teen Birth Rates</h3>
        <p>According to the <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr73/nvsr73-02.pdf'>CDC's birth rate report
                for 2022</a> and <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr035.pdf'>provisional data for 2023</a>,
            the birth rate for females ages 15 to 19 in the United States has steadily declined, reaching 13.6 births
            per 1,000 in 2022, a two-percent drop from 2021. </p>
        <p>Since 2009, the teen birth rate has consistently fallen, decreasing by 67 percent since 2007. In 2023, the
            birth rate dropped further to 13.2 births per 1,000, marking another record low.</p>
        <p>Dr. Brindis believes the steady decline is due to efforts encouraging teenagers to graduate from high school
            and changes in young girls' perceptions of motherhood.
        </p>
        <p>“More parents are graduating from high school, so their kids tend to graduate from high school. Some positive
            things are happening,” Dr. Brindis said. </p>
        <p>
            The huge decline in childbearing in the country is affecting all age groups. Many women and young people are
            opting not to have children because they're worried about financial burden and environmental issues, Dr.
            Brindis added.
        </p>
        <p>
            When looking at the teen birth rates by age group, we find the rate for teens aged 15 to 17 stayed steady at
            5.6 births per 1,000 in both 2022 and 2023. For younger teens aged 10 to 14, the rate has remained unchanged
            at 0.2 births per 1,000 since 2015. For older teens aged 18 to 19, the rate dropped from 25.8 births per
            1,000 in 2022 to a record low of 24.9 in 2023.

            Dr. Weed discussed why the birth rates for younger teens have remained unchanged over the past eight years,
            even as rates for other age groups have declined.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Younger teens face issues like unwanted sex, rape, and incest, and often feel too vulnerable to protect
            themselves,” Dr. Weed explained. “Many 12, 13, and 14-year-olds show curiosity and explore their sexuality,
            but sometimes find themselves in situations they can’t escape from and are reluctant to speak up due to fear
            or threats.”
        </p>
        <p>She also noted that in more conservative areas where abortion is nearly banned, young teens who become
            pregnant are often unable to terminate their pregnancies, making their situation even more challenging.</p>
        <p>Dr. Brindis explained that the unchanged rate for younger teens is due to the already low starting point,
            leaving less room for further decline. Unlike older teens, who generally have higher birth rates, the
            younger group’s rates are closer to a ceiling. To see further reductions in younger teens, there would need
            to be targeted support for those who are marginalized and have limited options, as these individuals are
            more likely to have fewer resources and alternatives besides keeping a baby.</p>
        <p>The huge drop in teen birth rates had also to do with social media and pop culture. “Since the 1990s, there
            have been more movies and television shows telling young people not to have sex unless they have a condom,”
            said Dr. Weed. “Safe sex is valued in today’s pop culture.”</p>

        <h3>Poverty is the Driver of Every Problem. But HOPE is Everything.</h3>
        <p>Since 2000, New York City has seen an 80 percent decrease in pregnancy rates among teenagers ages 15 to 19.
            However, despite this significant progress, poverty remains a key factor in neighborhoods with high teen
            birth rates.
        </p>
        <p>According to <a href='https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/vs/2021sum.pdf'>a 2021 vital statistics
                report</a> released by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, teen birth rates in
            very high-poverty neighborhoods (where 30 percent or more of the population lives below the Federal Poverty
            Line) were 14.1 births per 1,000 population, which is 4.2 times higher than in low-poverty neighborhoods
            (where less than 10 percent of the population lives below the Federal Poverty Line).</p>
        <p>“Poverty tends to inform those communities. Poverty not only impacted teen pregnancy rates but also high
            unemployment rate, levels of incarceration or rates of diabetes or poor housing stock,” said Raboni.“Poverty
            drives everything, but underneath poverty is structural racism.”
        </p>
        <p>She introduced that the neighborhoods that have been disinvested for decades in the city have been redlined
            and deeply segregated, with predominantly Black and Brown people living there.
            Parents in these disadvantaged neighborhoods may not have completed high school and are unable to secure
            high-paying jobs or health insurance that comes with those jobs, perpetuating these issues into the next
            generation.</p>
        <p>Beyond intergenerational financial poverty, various forms of poverty, including a lack of hope, can make teen
            moms even more vulnerable.</p>
        <p>
            “If a young person grows up believing they have many opportunities ahead and can achieve anything, they will
            hold on to that hope. That hope will drive them to access resources and opportunities, whether it's going to
            college or pursuing other goals, and they won't let anything stand in their way,” said Raboni. “Teenagers
            with hope are more likely to use birth control or delay becoming sexually active to stay on their chosen
            path.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Dr. Brindis stressed that a sense of future and a sense of empowerment is crucial. Teenagers need to have
            the ability to move on with their lives and not be truncated by the fact that they live in a bad
            neighborhood.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sense of hope is shaped by various social issues, including violence, alcohol and drugs. <a
                href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4653097/'>A study</a> examining risk factors
            contributing to teen pregnancy found a history of child
            maltreatment significantly increases the risk of teen pregnancy among low-income adolescents, even when
            accounting for neighborhood disadvantages and other issues. Dr. Weed also pointed out that domestic violence
            in teens’ families can lead to unwanted sex, which is the major reason for pregnancies among girls under 15,
            as they are unable to protect themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gun violence and substance abuse are also markers of community stability for teenagers. “In violent
            communities, young people face the threat of being shot or imprisoned. They may have a child because they
            want someone to care for their families,” said Dr. Brindis. “Also, when teenagers are addicted to alcohol
            and drugs, they often lack money, which reflects the community’s hopelessness.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond the living environments, students' important sense of hope is also largely shaped by messages they
            receive in schools and from adults around them.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Do they receive messages that they are smart and can succeed, or do they receive messages, particularly
            girls, that their currency, their value is based on how beautiful or attractive they are or whether or not
            they're able to have families, as opposed to that they're valuable because they're smart and they can go on
            to careers and things like that,” said Raboni.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, Sabrina's experience was different. She was a straight-A student involved in cheerleading and drama
            club, and no one expected her to get pregnant at 16 in 1986.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sabrina faced immense pressure when revealing her pregnancy. She had to explain her transfers between a
            maternity school and her original high school, and parents in her community used her as a cautionary
            example. Despite trying her best, her grades suffered as she juggled studying and caring for a baby. “That
            was definitely a self-esteem hit,” she said.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike some Black teen moms, Sabrina faced high expectations to succeed academically, compounded by
            judgments about her pregnancy. Fortunately, her supportive mother helped raise her child and encouraged her
            to stay hopeful, enabling Sabrina to graduate from college.
        </p>
        <p>
            “She said those people are making judgments and are not going to buy you diapers. They're not going to help
            you with milk. They're not going to take care of the baby. This is a gift from God and you're okay and we're
            going to do it together. So that gave me more strength to be, you know, stronger at the moment,” said
            Sabrina.

        <h3>Blue vs. Red Counties: The Importance of Sex Education</h3>
        <p>
            Data analysis reveals that counties with higher percentages of Trump voters in the 2020 election also report
            higher teen birth rates. <a
                href='https://creativematter.skidmore.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=socio_stu_stu_schol#:~:text=I%20have%20also%20considered%20the,states%20across%20all%20racial%20categories.'>A
                study</a> investigating conservative sex education policies supports this correlation, showing that
            states with more Republican voters are more likely to prioritize abstinence over contraception in their
            curricula. Both the study and the data regression model found that abstinence-based education fails to
            reduce teen birth rates.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dr. Weed believes abstinence education does not resonate with young people and sets unrealistic expectations
            for them, which is not being sexually active until getting married.
        </p>
        <p>
            “When teenagers enter relationships with this mindset, they are often unprepared when emotion takes over and
            don’t have contraceptives at hand when they want to have sex,” said Dr. Weed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dr. Weed highlighted that stressing abstinence would prevent teenagers from accessing the information they
            need. “Teenagers fear talking to their parents about getting or using condoms, and teachers here in South
            Carolina schools could be fired for providing sex-related information to students,” said Dr. Weed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regarding why “red counties” are being conservative toward teenagers’ sex, Dr. Brindis explained a “myth”
            there: adults feel like sex knowledge is dangerous—that knowledge puts ideas in young people's heads, and it
            causes young people to have sex, which Dr. Brindis believed is not true.
        </p>
        <p>
            Raboni said that teenagers are actually equally sexually active in “red” and “blue” counties, no matter if
            adults block their access to information. In fact, she thinks that sex education helps young people delay
            having sex—with more information, teenagers tend to be more responsible about using contraceptives. Raboni
            strongly opposes abstinence education, believing it very disrespectful to human behavior and human
            development.
        </p>
        <p>
            “It's like saying, I don't want you to get into a car accident, therefore never drive a car. And meanwhile,
            you live in a town where the only way for you to get around is to get in a car. And, you know, so
            eventually, you're going to have to be back in the car,” said Raboni. “People are going to be sexually
            active at some point.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Dr. Weed explained that abstinence education in schools reflects the views of the school board, leaders,
            families, and the entire community. "It's not just that it happens in the classroom. It's saying that this
            is the culture of the whole community," she said.
        </p>
        <p>
            In southern states like Mississippi and Louisiana, local officials are facing some of the nation's highest
            maternal mortality and morbidity rates. These regions often experience severe shortages of healthcare
            providers, known as "provider deserts," limiting access to essential care. In Mississippi, restrictive
            women's health policies have driven many OBGYNs out of the state, exacerbating the already critical shortage
            of healthcare services for women.

        <h4>Midland County: High Income, High Teen Birth Rate</h4>
        <p>
            Data analysis shows that if a county has a higher median household income, it tends to have a lower teen
            birth rate. However, Midland County in Texas is an outlier here—despite having a median household income
            of
            $90,000, around middle-level compared to all U.S. counties, it experienced the fourth-highest teen birth
            rate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Trey Lowe, the executive director of <a href='https://younglifemidland.younglife.org/'>Young Life
                Midland</a>, explained the reason from demographic and geographic factors.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Midland County, roughly 70% of students in the school districts are Hispanics. Many of them are
            first—or
            second-generation Americans. Since Midland County is a traditional oil and gas town, people can make
            significant profits without a degree.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data from <a href='https://data.census.gov/profile/Midland_County,_Texas?g=050XX00US48329'>Data USA</a>
            shows that in 2022, mining, quarrying, and oil & gas extraction was the largest industry in Midland
            County,
            employing nearly 1 in 5 people with a median annual income of $175,395. However, Midland County's
            educational attainment lags behind, with local universities awarding only 995 degrees that year, and
            just
            about one-third of the population holding a bachelor’s degree or higher—compared to nearly two-thirds in
            New
            York County (Manhattan).
        </p>
        <p>
            “So there isn't the desire to push your child into something if you don't think it's needed,” said Lowe.
            “Many kids go straight into the workforce instead of college, and many 19-year-olds get married right
            out
            of high school, with someone earning $100,000 in the oil field.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The difficulty of adhering to Christian values in the strongly religious Midland community also
            contributes
            to the high teen birth rate. Despite identifying as Christians, many teenagers still have sex.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Christianity is popular to profess but not to practice,” said Lowe. “Many claim to believe in God and
            Jesus, but it's less common for high school students to strictly follow biblical teachings. They might
            identify as Christians because of belief or occasional church attendance, but their faith isn't
            typically
            devout.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite Midland's high incomes, the cost of living offsets much of the wealth, with housing, food, and
            other
            essentials costing more than in other Texas counties, according to Lowe. He noted that Midland County
            operates in a financial bubble, where wages are inflated—even fast food chains like Whataburger pay $20
            an
            hour with benefits, twice the rate seen elsewhere in Texas.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Because if you have a pulse in half of a brain, you can go work in the oil field for three times the
            money,” said Lowe. “There's so much oil money that the service industry here has to pay higher wages to
            keep
            employees, which then goes into the cost of the product.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond the financial bubble, there is also the cultural norm of becoming a young mom after
            graduating
            from high school. Lowe’s mom had a daughter when she was 19 years old. He also started his family early
            and
            had a daughter when he was 18 years old.
        </p>
        <p>“It is not socially acceptable to have a child in high school, but once you graduate, it is definitely
            acceptable to start a family,” said Lowe. “But girls from higher socio-economic families here are still
            expected to pursue higher education rather than start a family.”</p>
        <p>In Texas, abortion has been banned since the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade in June 2022. In
            Midland
            County, where pro-life views dominate, some girls who wish to terminate their pregnancies drive 45
            minutes
            to Mexico for abortion services.</p>
        <p>“It is not something girls would be proud of to get pregnant here in high school. It's something they're
            ashamed of. So if they are having an abortion, they won’t let anyone know and move on with their life,”
            said
            Lowe.</p>
        <p>Beyond driving to Mexico, pregnant teens can also use morning-after pills for a drug abortion, which
            remains
            legal in some areas of Texas. However, these pills are only effective if taken at the right time in the
            pregnancy cycle, and most young people don’t know how to do this without adult guidance.</p>
        <p>“If you don't have doctors or professionals to tell you how to do the right thing, then younger people
            just
            gather abortion drugs and do it by themselves,” said Dr. Weed. “I feel like that will put them at risk.”

        <h4>Sex Education Programs in New York City </h4>
        <p>In contrast to Midland County, New York City advocates for earlier sex education. Raboni noted that since
            2011, the Department of Education has recommended public schools implement evidence-based sex education
            in sixth and ninth grades, and built various related programs to equip teenagers with the knowledge
            before they become sexually active to stay healthy.

        <p>With its developed system and effective education, New York City has seen an 80% decrease in pregnancy
            rates among teens aged 15 to 19 since 2000, which is 8% greater han the national decline in teen birth
            rates. </p>
        <p>“I think the reason for the decline in birth rates is that young people are becoming sexually active
            later, when they have more critical thinking skills,” said Raboni. Dr. Brindis added that, on a national
            level, fewer teenagers are going on dates, which also contributes to delayed sexual activity.</p>
        <p>But that doesn’t mean that young people have stopped becoming sexually active. She believes early sex
            education and accessible contraception had a primary impact in decreasing teen pregnancy rates over the
            past 20 years. </p>
        <p>Looking ahead, Dr. Brindis emphasized the need to shift more people toward supporting early sex education
            and moving away from the belief that sex knowledge leads teens to have sex earlier. </p>
        <p>“Engaging families in sex education is crucial since many parents lack sufficient sex education
            themselves and don’t have the skills to be effective educators,” said Dr. Brindis. </p>
